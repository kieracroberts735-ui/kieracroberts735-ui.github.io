Hello! My name is Kiera Roberts and this is my blog dedicated to reporting my work and progress in my field.

I attend the University of Memphis and am majoring in Chinese with an expected graduation date of 2029.

Right now my life goal is learning as many languages as I can and some hobbies of mine are baking, reading, learning new languages, and windsurfing.

My favorite subject in college is my major - Chinese.

Introduction


Cancer research has changed dramatically in the last decade. Instead of just looking at tumors under a microscope, scientists now read their genomes — the complete DNA code inside every cancer cell. This has revealed hundreds, even thousands, of mutations in every tumor, but only a few of them really matter.



In this post, we’ll explain what genomic sequencing has taught us about tumor mutations, with clear definitions of important terms like SNPs, driver genes, and oncogenes — just like you’d expect in a well-structured GitHub Pages blog post.

Why Genomic Sequencing Matters


Genomic sequencing is the process of reading the entire DNA sequence of a cell. When scientists sequence tumor DNA and compare it to normal DNA from the same person, they can spot mutations — changes in the DNA code — that are unique to the cancer.



This approach has transformed how researchers think about cancer. Instead of one disease, we now see cancer as many diseases defined by unique combinations of mutations.

Key Definitions


Before we go further, let’s define some terms you’ll see a lot:

SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) – These are changes in one letter of the DNA code. Imagine a single typo in a very long sentence. Some SNPs change how a gene works, and others do nothing at all.

Driver Mutations & Driver Genes – Not all mutations affect how a cancer grows. Driver mutations drive the cancer forward. They occur in driver genes — genes whose changes give cells a growth advantage.

Oncogenes – These are genes that normally help cells grow and divide. When they mutate in certain ways, they become overactive and push the cell to grow uncontrollably.

Tumor Suppressor Genes – These genes normally slow down cell growth or fix DNA damage. Mutations that inactivate them remove that control, making cancer more likely.

Passenger vs. Driver Mutations


One of the biggest lessons from genomic sequencing is that tumors contain many mutations, but only a few are important.

Passenger mutations happen randomly and don’t affect tumor behavior.

Driver mutations affect key genes that change how cells grow, divide, or die.



Studies like Vogelstein et al. (2013) showed that most cancers require only about 2–8 driver mutations to form, even though the tumor may have hundreds of other changes. Only a small number of mutations actually drive the disease.



This insight helped researchers focus on the mutations that really matter when designing therapies.

Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors


Drivers tend to fall into two categories:



Oncogenes


These behave like a car’s gas pedal stuck down — they push the cell to grow.

Example: KRAS is a classic oncogene: when mutated, it can fuel tumor growth.



Tumor Suppressor Genes


These act like brakes — when they work, they slow down growth.

Example: TP53, a very common tumor suppressor, gets mutated in many cancers, removing that brake.



By sequencing tumor genomes, researchers have identified key oncogenes and tumor suppressors across many cancer types.

Mutational Signatures and Cancer Causes


Another exciting finding from cancer genomics: tumors carry signatures of how they were damaged.



Different causes — like UV light, tobacco smoke, or aging — leave different patterns of mutations in DNA. These patterns are called mutational signatures.



By reading these signatures, researchers can sometimes track what caused a cancer — like how UV light leaves a distinct fingerprint in skin cancers.

Why This Matters for Patients


Understanding the genetic makeup of tumors is not just academic — it guides real treatment decisions:

Doctors can look for targetable mutations and choose drugs that specifically block those changes.

Some tumors with lots of mutations respond better to immunotherapy.

Sequencing can help identify rare mutations that point to clinical trials or experimental therapies.



This precision medicine approach means treatments can be tailored to the mutation profile of an individual’s tumor.

Conclusion


Genomic sequencing has completely changed how we understand cancer. Some of the most important lessons include:

Tumors carry many mutations, but only a few drivers matter.

Driver genes include both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

SNPs are the most common mutation type, but only some alter cancer behavior.

Mutational signatures can reveal a tumor’s history.

Sequencing directly affects diagnosis and treatment.



As researchers continue to sequence more cancers, we’re learning even more about how tumors evolve, resist therapy, and how we can treat them more effectively.
